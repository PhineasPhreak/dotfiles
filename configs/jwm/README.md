# JWM (Joe's Window Manager)
[JWM](https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/) is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System. JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum. Because of its small footprint, JWM makes a good window manager for older computers and less powerful systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, though it is perfectly capable of running on modern systems. JWM is included in small Linux distributions such as Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux, and it is available as a separate package in many other distributions.

# Download
See [GitHub](http://github.com/joewing/jwm/) for recent updates.

# Installation
JWM is distributed in source form (available here), however, several distributions make JWM available as a binary package. Note that pre-compiled versions of JWM are often older than the newest version available here. To check the version of JWM, run "jwm -v" from a command line.

- To customize JWM, copy `.jwmrc` file to `"$HOME/.jwmrc"` and then modify it using your favorite text editor.
- Copy the `.jwm/` folder to `$HOME/.jwm`.


# Documentation
See the [configuration documentation](https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/config.html) for comprehensive documentation on configuring JWM. JWM also comes with a manual page (run "man jwm" on the command line after installing JWM).
