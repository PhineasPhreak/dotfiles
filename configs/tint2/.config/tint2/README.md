## tint2 Configuration file : 
tint2 is a simple, unobtrusive and light panel for Xorg. It can be configured to include a system tray, a task list, 
a battery monitor and more. Its look is configurable and it only has few dependencies, 
making it ideal for window managers like Openbox, that do not come with a panel. 

### Installation :
The first time you run tint2, it will create the config file in `$HOME/.config/tint2/tint2rc` 
>(This is true if you have done a clean install.
Running tint2 in the source directory without doing 'make install' will not create the config file.)

* After the frist execution copy this file `tint2rc` to `$HOME/.config/tint2/`

* Useful command for tint2 :
  * `tint2` (For execution)
   * `tint2conf` (For control panel of tint2)
