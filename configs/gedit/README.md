# gedit themes
Yes, themes. Are you dissatisfied with the plain black-on-white color scheme? Maybe you prefer a darker theme with bold neon colors for keywords while programming? Or perhaps you simply want to look at pretty, new colors?

## One Theme At A Time Method
If you have a few themes, then this method is probably the best. Open gedit, and go to `Edit > Preferences > Font & Colors` tab. </br>
Next, click the small “+” button to add a theme. Navigate to the xml theme file and open it. The theme will be added to gedit, ready for immediate use.

## Multiple Copy Method in gedit theme
Themes are stored in the `$HOME/.local/share/gedit/styles` directory. </br>
This is a hidden directory in your home. Simply copy all theme xml files to this directory. However, you must restart gedit in order to detect and use the themes.

> To use a theme, select it from the Color Scheme list box. Gedit instantly changes.

**By default on linux system (Debian) themes are stored in the `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles`**
